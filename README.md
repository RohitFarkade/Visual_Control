# Visual_Control

Visual_Control is a Python-based project that implements visual control systems using deep learning techniques. The project integrates gesture recognition with navigation and media control functionalities, allowing for interactive control using visual inputs. Detailed instructions on running the project, along with a mini project report, are included.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes deep learning (see the `DL_GesRecognition` folder) to recognize gestures for control commands.
- **Navigation Mode**: Implements visual navigation control through `NavigationMode.py` and `navigation_clone.py`.
- **Media Mode**: Provides functionality for controlling media applications via `MediaMode.py`.
- **Documentation**: Includes a How-To guide (`HowToRun.docx`) and a comprehensive project report (`Mini Project Report.pdf`).


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
-  Jupyter Notebook â€“ if you plan to run or modify notebook files
- Required libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)  
  *(Please refer to the `HowToRun.docx` for a complete list of dependencies.)*
